# Satellite-Imagery-Change-Detection

**ClusterImageChanges.R** is my contribution to the team project of detecting change in high resolution satellite imagery.

This files clusters image-grid-changes,modelled as Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergences, in the before-and-after satellite images using k-means clustering.

The **.dat** consists of the data used to cluster image grid changes.
